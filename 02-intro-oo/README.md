## Agenda

- Teach our app what a `User` is
    - A `User` has a `name`
    - A `User` has an `age`
    - A `User` has `ss_number`
    - A `User` can change their `name`, `age`, and `ss_number`
    - A `User` should be able to say it's `name` and `age`
    - A `User`should not be able to show their `ss_number`
- A `User` can sign in, view, and edit their personal information
